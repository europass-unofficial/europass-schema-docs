# Europass CV XML Schema Documentation (Unofficial)

This repository contains an **unofficial, community maintained** Markdown conversion of
the Europass CV XML Schema documentation (v3.0.0, 17/02/2020).

It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by** the European Union,
the European Commission, or CEDEFOP.

## Why this repository exists

The Europass2 CV XML Schema documentation is officially published as a PDF document.
The format is not optimized for navigation, linking, version control,
or collaborative review.

This repository exists to:
- Convert the existing documentation into **structured Markdown**
- Improve **readability, navigation, and searchability**
- Enable **transparent discussion and clarification** through issues and pull requests
- Provide a practical reference for developers and institutions working with the schema

## TODO

- Fix broken Mermaid diagrams in the MkDocs site.
- Considering using the original diagram images as a fallback (Not a good solution, not machine-readable).

## Contributing

This is a community-maintained project. Feel free to suggest improvements or report issues on GitHub.
